## List of Projects:- 
### 1. [Classification of Arrhythmia using ECG Data]((https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Classification%20of%20Arrhythmia))

| [Notebook File](https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Classification%20of%20Arrhythmia/final%20with%20pca.ipynb) | [Complete Project](https://github.com/shsarv/Project-Arrhythmia)| [Dataset](https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Classification%20of%20Arrhythmia/Data/arrhythmia.csv) |
|----|----|----|

- The goal of this project is to predict if a person is suffering from cardiac arrhythmia or not and if yes, classify it into one of 12 available groups.
- The Dataset used in this project is available at the UCI machine learning Repository. It can be found [Here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia).
- The best Model was Kernelized SVM over PCA Data.
- **Accuracy achieved = 80.21%**


### 2. [Diabetes-prediction](https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Diabetes%20Prediction)

| [Notebook File](https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Diabetes%20Prediction/Diabetes%20Classification.ipynb) | [Complete Deployed Project](https://github.com/shsarv/Diabetes-prediction) | [Dataset](https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Diabetes%20Prediction/dataset) | [Working Link](https://sarvdiabetes-predictions.herokuapp.com/)
|----|----|----|----|
- The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
- The data set that has used in this project has taken from the kaggle . "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  
- Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage".
- The model best worked on this dataset was Random Forest Classifier.
- **Accuracy achieved = 98.75%**
